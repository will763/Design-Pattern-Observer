# Design-Pattern-Observer

In this challenge I developed the Design Pattern Observer. The Observer is a Design Pattern that has a one-to-many relationship, that is, when an object has its state changed, all its dependents are notified and updated. In this case, our object is the Temperature and its dependents are the Air Conditioning and the Heater, in the challenge, both are watching the temperature status, and when it changes, both are notified and updated.]

## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

instantiate the classes in the main class and do your tests, for example changing the temperature value and seeing the messages in the console.

### What I learned

I had an introduction to design patterns, and their principles and which are the most used. I realized that frameworks use them in their implementations.
